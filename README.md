Order Book Fast Algorithm develop by Alan Z. Valencia

This is an Order Book that I designed for run efficiently and fast.

You can download and use it freely.

The source code can run in any Linux and Windows OS.

I've initially tested it to run in Linux.

You can use run.sh in Linux to build and run it.

Use the following command in Linux:

sudo sh run.sh
